      <p>
        For my cs1300 Development assignment, I have created a mock shopping site for mechanical keyboards. Users can view the different keyboards and their descriptions, sort them by price,
        filter for certain brands, and add them to a cart for purchasing.
        You can visit the site by clicking on the image below.

              <td>To keep the flow of the page clear and easy to use, the cards are on the left page, while the cart is on the right page. This is inspired by the TA example.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">2</th>
              <td>In order to give the user control and freedom. There are multiple ways of adding items to the cart. Users could either add them through the "add to cart" button, or
                by incrementing the quantity. If a user does not notice the "+" button to increment the quantity, clicking the add to cart button again would work.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">3</th>
              <td>There is clear information about the search results provided by the filtering and sorting. The prices and switches of the keyboards is clearly visible, and when
                no items match the search query, there is a message letting the user know.
              </td>
            </tr>
